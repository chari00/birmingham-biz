# SEO Plan for Birmingham Business Website Handover

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive SEO plan for the Birmingham Business website. This plan outlines actionable steps for optimising the app's search engine performance and maintaining it after the handover. The app uses React and Next.js for the frontend, deployed on Vercel, and Strapi CMS for the backend, deployed on Railway.

## 1. Initial SEO Setup

1. **Meta Tags**:

   - Ensure all pages, especially news articles, have unique and descriptive meta titles and descriptions.
   - Use dynamic meta tags in Next.js to automate this process for new articles.

2. **Canonical URLs**:

   - Implement canonical tags to avoid duplicate content issues.

3. **Open Graph Tags**:

   - Add Open Graph tags for better social media sharing.

4. **Favicon**:
   - Ensure the site has a favicon for brand recognition.

## 2. Content and Keyword Strategy

1. **Keyword Research**:

   - Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush to expand on the initial keyword list.
   - Focus on keywords such as "Birmingham business news", "West Midlands news", etc.

2. **Content Optimization**:

   - Ensure each news article targets specific keywords from the list.
   - Use keywords in the title, headings, and naturally throughout the content.

3. **Content Updates**:
   - Regularly update and optimise older articles to keep them relevant.

## 3. Technical SEO

1. **Next.js Optimization**:

   - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Check if SSR is used by inspecting the HTML source of your pages. If the content is pre-rendered, SSR is likely enabled. Use the `getServerSideProps` function in Next.js for SSR.
   - **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Use `getStaticProps` for pages that do not change often to improve loading times.
   - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Use ISR to keep static content up to date.

2. **Page Speed**:

   - Optimise images using Next.js `next/image`.
   - Use lazy loading for images and other heavy resources.
   - Minimize JavaScript and CSS files.

3. **Mobile Optimization**:

   - Ensure the site is fully responsive and provides a good user experience on mobile devices.

4. **Structured Data**:
   - Implement structured data (Schema.org) for articles to help search engines understand and display your content better.

## 4. On-Page SEO

1. **Title Tags and Headers**:

   - Use descriptive and keyword-rich title tags and header tags (H1, H2, H3) for all articles.

2. **Alt Text for Images**:

   - Add descriptive alt text to all images.

3. **Internal Linking**:
   - Use internal links to guide users and search engines through related articles and categories.

## 5. Backend (Strapi CMS)

1. **SEO-Friendly URLs**:

   - Ensure URLs are clean, descriptive, and include relevant keywords.

2. **Sitemap**:

   - Generate and submit a sitemap to search engines. Configure Strapi to auto-generate this.

3. **Robots.txt**:

   - Create a robots.txt file to guide search engines on which pages to crawl.

4. **301 Redirects**:
   - Implement 301 redirects for any changed or deleted pages to preserve link equity.
