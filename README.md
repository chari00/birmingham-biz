As part of our final project at School of Code, Codey McCodeface have been partnered with Birmingham Business Magazine to help them find a solution to optimising their online presence.

## Initial brief

## Refined problem statement
Birmingham Business magazine’s website is outdated and not engaging, which means they are not maximising traffic to their site and stories. It is also difficult to manage from the editors’ side.

## The solution
A revamped platform that prioritises user engagement,  accessibility, and content management efficiency while also optimising SEO to drive more traffic, transforming the digital experience.

## MVP 1

## User flow 

We created a user flow diagram to help visualise how a user would navigate the different sections of the website and actions they are able to take on each page, ensuring seemless flow throughout our MVP.  This would help us with the bulid stages later on.

## Wireframing

After initial ideation and user research stages we began work on the design of the website using the research we had gathered.  We created wireframes in Figma for the three pages of our first MVP.

## How we worked

We created a ticketing system in GitHub projects to assign jobs to team members.  We also split off into smaller groups of either 2 or 3 in order to cover more ground.  We rotated our pairs regularly so that each of us was able to work with every other member and also to get a holistic understanding of the project and broaden our skillset in all areas of the software development process.
