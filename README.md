## Refined problem statement
Birmingham Business magazine’s website is outdated and not engaging, which means they are not maximising traffic to their site and stories. It is also difficult to manage from the editors’ side.

## The solution
A revamped platform that prioritises user engagement,  accessibility, and content management efficiency while also optimising SEO to drive more traffic, transforming the digital experience.
